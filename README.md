This project will be an attempt to replicate the Google home page.  It should demonstrate knowledge and expertise with alignment, spacing, and functionality.
After completing the project, I had a lot to learn.  I learned a lot of different ways to use html and css together.  At first, I tried to set up the project with a hybrid of css flexbox grid with columns and container positioning.  Then, I tried to set it up with just CSS flexbox grid and the same div containers.  That didn't work either.  Then I tried to set it up floating div containers and found out that would work for the top elements but that the bottom elements would either have to be parent-orphan with relative and absolute fix or I could hybridize it with container positioning with flexbox grid.  While the final outcome is not perfect, I think it is pretty good for a beginner level project.  I still can't figure out how to use the webkit filters to change the png color with the icon for audio, but I think this is a good start.
